# Riddler Castles Puzzle genetic algorithm simulation

The [Riddler's Castles Puzzle](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/blob/master/riddler-castles/README.md) is a competition amongst readers in a "Colonel Blotto"-style game. Multiple rounds were run, each time with prior submission data made public.

This tool is an attempt to simulate possible trajectories of evolving strategies  under different game parameters through the use of genetic algorithms.

Use `cargo run -- -help` to see usage.
